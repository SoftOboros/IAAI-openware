# IAAI Openware (Standards Discussion Body Formation Kernel)

**This repository is a kernel for forming standards discussion bodies and bootstrapping working groups.**

IAAI Openware provides the initial structure and process examples for establishing working groups focused on open standards. It is a **process bootstrap exercise**, not a runnable software stack in itself. The included code and documents serve as examples to facilitate discussion and collaboration.

---

## What This Is

IAAI Openware is a launchpad for:

-   **Forming Working Groups:** A framework for proposing, discussing, and establishing working groups.
-   **Bootstrapping Processes:** Example documents and structures to kickstart the work of new groups.
-   **Standards Discussion:** A neutral ground for interested parties to collaborate on open standards.

The focus is on the **process of formation**, with the initial proposed working groups serving as live examples.

## Working Groups as Process Bootstrap Exercises

The working groups proposed within this repository are exercises in bootstrapping the process of a standards body. They are not yet formal committees but rather living examples of how a working group can be proposed, structured, and initiated.

The current proposed working groups are:

-   [Provenance](/working-groups/proposed/Provenance/README.md)
-   [Vendor-Agnostic API](/working-groups/proposed/Vendor-Agnostic-API/README.md)

## Core Concepts

The core concept is the formation of a standards body itself. The initial state of this repository is the "Day 0" of that process.

## Table of Contents

For a full overview of the documents in this repository, please see the [Table of Contents](/TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md).

## Relationship to IAAI Foundation

-   This repository is **open** and standalone, intended to facilitate the formation of an independent standards body.
-   The IAAI Foundation acts as a facilitator in this initial phase.
